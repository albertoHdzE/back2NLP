For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made.

Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend.
